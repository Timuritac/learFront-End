            <p>let's go to the beginning of training and the concept of what IT is?Many people think that it is very difficult to do it , but I will try to explain to you that it is easier than easy . For example, people think that IT is when you sit for days and nights at your gadget without getting up from the chair.I'm afraid you'll be disappointed that this is actually not the case . To start any job, you need to have a living . You do not need to think from the first days that IT is a way of earning money and that you will earn after the first study of a million dollars . You need to think before you start studying</p>

But first you need to know the theory about Front-End and Back-End. To understand what you have just read. Imagine a person. What does he have? We see the body, face, body parts, hair, and so on. But we don't see what's inside. It's the same here .  Site body → Front-End .  Inner Part →Back-End If you want to choose a career path in software development, you may want to get a clear understanding of the difference between frontend and backend development.
        These two terms are the most used terms in web development and act as the most fundamental parts of software engineering.
        Frontend and backend development is very important for developing a website or web application, but they are totally different.
        Each of them has its own unique role in developing a website or application. You can see them as the two sides of a coin, different but coming together to achieve a common goal (website)  
        The front-end is basically what you see and interact with when you visit a website, like buttons, links, images, etc.  
        The backend is that part of the website that you cannot see or interact with directly.
